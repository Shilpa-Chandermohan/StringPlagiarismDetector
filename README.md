# StringPlagiarismDetector
String Plagiarism detector is a java project where 4 algorithms are implemented that detect for plagiarism in agiven file by comparing it gaianst a corpus of data. 
The alorithms implemented are LCSS, Naive, KMP and Booyer moore. 

Flow of the Project:
	
1. The source code has many java classes which are:--> KMP.java, LCSS.java, booyermoore.java and naiveSearch.java:

   a) KMP.java : Has the KMP algorithm implementation.
   
   b) LCSS.java : Has the LCSS algorithm implementation.
   
   c) BMSubStr.java : Has the Boyer Moore algorithm implementation.
   
   d) Naive.java : Has Naive string comparison algorithm implementation.

2. To the code, download the whole file, open the files in /stringalgos folder and run the on eclipse. The output will be displayed on the console.
